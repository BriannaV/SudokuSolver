# SudokuSolver

This project solves a sudoku board that is given in an input .sdk file. One is given here to show how it should be formatted. 

The .sdk file should have a "." placed where the number on the board is missing and a number everywhere else.


This code should run on a terminal with the example .sdk file when you type: python3 sudoku.py test.sdk
